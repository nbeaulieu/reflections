When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

Using a remote repository makes sense if you are working on more than one
computer or if there is more than one contributor to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically staying up to date with the remote repository introduces 
the risk of losing local work or advancing the local version to the 
remote prematurely if you were still testing or considering other tasks 
or features that are local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a remote repository that links back to the orginal 
repository.  A clone is a copy of a repository.  A branch contains 
different versions of the same file(s) within the same repository.  
Branches are good for experimental features, new feature development, and 
changes to existing or released code without inclucing the full matser 
branch.  A fork is a good choice when the original repository is not your 
own.  A clone is required for working with repositories and remotes.
