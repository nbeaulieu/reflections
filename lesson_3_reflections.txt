When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

Using a remote repository makes sense if you are working on more than one
computer or if there is more than one contributor to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically staying up to date with the remote repository introduces 
the risk of losing local work or advancing the local version to the 
remote prematurely if you were still testing or considering other tasks 
or features that are local.
