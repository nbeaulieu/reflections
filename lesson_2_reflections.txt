What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a responsitory sets up the git structure for the files in the 
directory.  This must occur before files can be archived or tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area provides intermediate/working storage for files the 
respository.  This allows users to work on a commit set, refine it, and 
commit when happy with the staged files and commit.
